# Medical-research-02--ECG-data-classification

This project is to use a large but imbalanced ECG dataset for a case study and implement, validate, and optimize some machine learning solutions for the analysis and classification of heartbeat data.

Resources 

Download the MIT-BIH dataset from this Kaggle website:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shayanfazeli/heartbeat

It contains two subsets as CSV files. Use the file “mitbih_train.csv” for analysis, training, and validation, and “mitbih_test.csv” for testing. Carry out a statistical comparison of the two subsets.

Explore the possible use of various unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms.

This project contains: 

1. Visual, exploratory data analysis. 
2. Classification of heartbeat types. Use three classification algorithms to tackle the problem; employ a comprehensive performance evaluation scheme. Performance tuning and model interpretation.
